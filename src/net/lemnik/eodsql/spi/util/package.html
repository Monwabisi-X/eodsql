            The <code>net.lemnik.eodsql.spi.util</code> package contains many helper classes
            to aid in the creation of third-party <a href="../QueryFactory.html">QueryFactorie</a>s
            and <a href="../MethodImplementation.html">MethodImplementation</a>s. The package
            is mostly focused on providing the automatic binding mechanism used in the
            <a href="../../impl/DefaultQueryFactory.html">standard QueryFactory</a>.
        </p><p>
            The classes in this package are capable of automatically wrap a
            ResultSet in all the standard type: arrays, <code>List</code>,
            <code>Set</code>, <code>Collection</code>, <code>DataSet</code> and
            <code>DataIterator</code>. The package is also used to create
            bindings to the base data-object's (which can also be customized).
        </p>
        <h2>How this package is arranged</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="Query.html">Query</a> class is responsible for decoding
            EoD SQL query strings. It doesn't decode the SQL contained in
            a query (and therefore could contain any query language).
        </p><p>
            <a href="ResultSetWrapper.html">ResultSetWrapper</a> is both
            the parent class and the registry for classes that wrap a
            <code>ResultSet</code> object in another object format. Thus
            a <code>ResultSetWrapper</code> implementation is generally
            responsible for creating the objects returned from annotated
            methods.
        </p><p>
            Some of the <a href="ResultSetWrapper.html">ResultSetWrapper</a>
            implementations include additional parameters that may be
            passed to them when they are created. These are usually bound
            to an attribute on their related annotation type.
        </p><p>
            A <code>ResultSetWrapper</code> generally delegates the "row"
            binding to a <a href="DataObjectBinding.html">DataObjectBinding</a>
            object. A <code>DataObjectBinding</code> is either bound to
            a specific <a href="DataObjectBinding.html#setDefaultDataObjectBinding(java.lang.Class)">type</a>
            (excluding any sub-types) or as a fallback (or default) binding.
